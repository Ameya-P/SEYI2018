## Advanced Test
### A Mystical Rite of Passage
1. Write a function that returns the phrase "Hello, World."
	* x

### Problem Set
1. Load the iris dataset we used in the earlier tests. Write a function that takes iris as its argument, and returns three subsets of the data.frame split by the three different types of species (saved as a single object).
	* x
2. Write a function that takes iris as its argument. The function should, for each row, add Sepal.Length and Petal.Length if Sepal.Width is > 3.1. It should substract Petal.Length from Sepal.Length if Sepal.Width is <3.1. The answer should be returned as a vector.
	* x
3. Load the mtcars dataset we used in the earlier tests. Write a function that takes a number of cylinders as its argument. Have the function return the average miles per gallon (column mpg) for all cars with that many cylinder (column cyl).
	* x
4. Write a function that simulates 1,000,000 powerball drawings. A powerball drawing takes a random sample of 5 numbers (without replacement) from 1 through 69, plus one powerball number ranging from 1 through 26. The function should return a single object recording all of your draws.
	* x
5. Write a function that take a single set of lottery numbers (as a vector) as its argument. As before, write a function that simulates 1,000,000 powerball drawings. Have the function return a TRUE or FALSE value if you won any of the drawings.
	* x
