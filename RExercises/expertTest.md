## Expert Test
1. What is the mean, median, and standard deviation of precip?
	* x
2. Is precip best visualized using a barplot( ) or hist( )? Why?
	* x
3. Generate a vector of random numbers drawn from a normal distribution with the same mean, standard deviation, and number of elements as in the precip dataset. Name this vector RandomNormal.
	* x
4. Write a function that tests, based on the means of each distribution, whether it is likely that RandomNormal and precip were drawn from the same underlying distribution.
	* x
5. Create a density( ) plot of precip and RandomNormal. Is the test you performed above (question 4) a good or bad indicator of whether the two distributions are identical? Why or why not?
	* x
