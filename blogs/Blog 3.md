I can’t believe it’s all over. It felt like just yesterday I was writing my first blog. 

To anyone who is thinking about applying to this program: Do it! If you are new to scientific research like I was but have always been interested in science, then this is the program for you. You’ll learn about the different parts of the research process, how to read and write scientific papers, how to analyze data with R, how to conduct filed research and more! This was an amazing summer and an awesome introduction to scientific research and I’m sad to see it end. 

I would like to end my blog by thanking Noel for being the best supervisor ever this year! He helped us out alot and taught us so much about geology and paleobiology. He was a great and helpful instructor when we were learning R. I found his feedback when we were writing to be really valuable. I thought his approach to teaching (having us read scientific papers and discuss both the content and writing style) was an effective and efficient way to teach us. His passion for geology and evolution spread to me as well during this summer! Also thank you to John Payne for allowing us into his lab, teaching us about his research and helping us with figures! Thank you to everyone else in the Payne Paleobiology lab was sharing their research with us and tallking to us about their experiences! 

I would also like to thank Jenny for accepting me into the program and coordinating these fun field trips and guest speakers for us! I would never have been able to have such a astounding summer without you! Also, thank you to Nic for checking up on all of us during the course of this internship and teaching us about his research with fungi! 

Senior year starts in only two weeks. I’m both scared and excited to apply to colleges and being in this summer program really helped me decide what I want to do in the future.
