I can’t believe it’s all over. It felt like just yesterday I was writing my first blog. There isn't a title for this blog because I really don't want to end this.

Since my last blog, I’ve mostly just been working on trying to complete our section of the paper. After the figure presentations with Dr.Jon Payne, we realized that we had a lot to do in regards to our graphs. For the whole group, we needed to standardize the style of our graphs which included trying to find a color-blind friendly palette (an endeavor which took 3 hours to accomplish!).  For Loc and I, we needed to create a box plot, proportional plot, AIC weight table and totally revitalize the graphs we had previously made. While a bit stressful having to add stuff last minute, it made for quite a learning experience. 

We also finished the process of writing our portions of the paper during these past weeks. This included writing figure captions, methods, results and a discussion section. It was incredibly brutal starting on these but we managed to make it in the end. However, I still think our discussion section needs a touch up. 

One of our last activities was concluding John Tyler Bonner’s *Why Size Matters*. It was a fascinating book, delving into a subject I never really gave much consideration to. The discussions we had were great practice for socratics during the school year and it was fun coming up with discussion questions when it was our time to lead. 

However, the last 3 weeks wasn’t just typing away at a computer and reading papers. 2 weeks ago, we went on a research boat and learned all about what they do there. Our instructor for the day described his journey through high school and college in oceanography and told us what we could do if we wanted to follow the same path. To teach us more about research methods and marine animals, we broke up into 3 stations: Picking up marine life off of the bay floor with a claw, catching fish with a net, and studying plankton and water quality. The absolute best experience of these 3 (though they were all incredibly fun!) was throwing the net and identifying the sea creatures we caught. I’m somewhat of a hands on learner and I loved petting the various fish we caught! The cutest fish was the baby leopard shark followed by this small bat ray. I also enjoyed just looking out onto the ocean and watching the green waters lap against the boat. 

This week was one of the most eventful by far. On Monday during this last week, we had a potluck filled with yummy food that everyone in the lab brought. On Tuesday, we visited the farm and saw different experiments that people were working on such as a better irrigation system, a cost-effective and improved method of drying chillies, and Nic’s experiments with different fungi (such as the Pink Flamingo Oyster mushrooms). We also made our own delicious pizzas with fresh ingredients from the farm! Thursday was our final day, filled with presentations from all the interns. It was cool to both present what I had been doing all summer with Loc and learning about what other interns had been doing.

To anyone who is thinking about applying to this program: Do it! If you are new to scientific research like I was but have always been interested in science, then this is the program for you. You’ll learn about the different parts of the research process, how to read and write scientific papers, how to analyze data with R, how to conduct field research and more! This was an amazing summer and an awesome introduction to scientific research and I’m sad to see it end. 

I would like to end my blog by thanking Noel for being the best supervisor ever this year! He helped us out alot and taught us so much about geology and paleobiology. He was a great and helpful instructor when we were learning R. I found his feedback when we were writing to be really valuable. I thought his approach to teaching (having us read scientific papers and discuss both the content and writing style) was an effective and efficient way to teach us. His passion for geology and evolution spread to me as well during this summer! Also thank you to John Payne for allowing us into his lab, teaching us about his research and helping us with figures! Thank you to everyone else in the Payne Paleobiology lab was sharing their research with us and talking to us about their experiences! 

I would also like to thank Jenny for accepting me into the program and coordinating these fun field trips and guest speakers for us! I would never have been able to have such a astounding summer without you! Also, thank you to Nic for checking up on all of us during the course of this internship and teaching us about his research with fungi! 

Senior year starts in only two weeks. I’m both scared and excited to apply to colleges and being in this summer program really helped me decide what I want to do in the future. I’m so sad it ended but I’m glad that we’ll all be staying in touch to work on the paper during the school year!

Good bye my fellow interns and Stanford! It was a fantastic summer!
