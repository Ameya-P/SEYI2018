It’s my fifth week in the Stanford Earth Young Investigators Program and I can’t believe we are over halfway done. It’s startling how fast the summer has passed and how I’m inching closer and closer to my final year of high school. Even though it still feels like very little time has passed, we’ve explored a plethora of places here in the Bay and in Central California as well as learned about a ton of topics in Geology, Paleobiology, and coding.

Two weeks ago, we went on a trip to New Brighton State Beach to see fossils of marine animals, view the geology of the area and identify as many phyla as possible at the beach. It was fun tiptoeing across rocks, trying to avoid the incoming tides, all while looking for different fossils. The most prominent were the ones from the phylum Mollusca. They could be viewed in rocks all over the ground as well as in shelf beds on the cliff sides. The cliffs, displaying different layers of sedimentary rock, were covered with small crawling isopods and the occasional enormous one. The whale bones were pretty difficult to stop because they looked like stripes within the rocks. The best part of the beach was definitely seeing the tiny shy rock crabs hiding in little crevices made by the piles of stone on the beach.  At the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, we saw a fully constructed blue whale skeleton. It was around the width of the building and originated from a beached whale. Within the skeleton, we were able to view the vestigial hind legs which I had only read about in a biology textbook at school.

Last week, we stayed overnight at Pinnacles National Park where we camped and learned about the local geology. It had been years since my last excursion to the woods and nearly a decade since the last time I had actually been camping so there was a steep learning curve when it came to setting up the tent and dealing with the various insects of the outdoors. Despite the countless yellow jackets, mobs of flies that stuck to your skin, and the difficult to sleep on nature floor, the trip was a ton of fun. On the first day, we searched for fossils by the highway in 100-degree weather. I found a couple of Mollusk fossils, similar to those from New Brighton State Beach and I sadly found no crab fossils. After getting to the campsite and setting up, we intended to go on a short hike up to the caves. We didn’t get to see them due to bats so instead, we went up to the reservoir and saw groups of dragonflies, damselflies, and a singular unmoving frog. After eating and walking around the camping ground, we stargazed and saw a few shooting stars. The next day, we had done our big and foreboding hike up to the summit. I, being incredibly unathletic, had felt like I was going to die while trying to make it up but ultimately we reached the top. On the hike, we learned a little bit about the geologic history of Pinnacles. Pinnacles were formed after the eruption of the Neenach Volcano. Because of the San Andreas fault, which is a transform fault, half of the formation was moved 200 miles away. 

Back at the Geology Corner, we focused on analyzing data using R for our research project. My partner Loc and I were making graphs based on extinction rate, speciation rate, diversification rate and mean body size. The next thing we will do is analyze the trends that we see within the graphs.

That’s all for now. Goodbye!
