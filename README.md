## Stanford Earth Young Investigators 2018

#### I'm really excited to be a biodiversity intern at the Geology Corner this summer! For 8 weeks, we will be working on a paper on body size evolution in Marine animals. Our research will be divided up into 5 groups: Phyla, Respiration Anatomy, Tiering, Motility and Feeding. I will be focusing on the five phyla (Arthropods, Brachiopods, Chordates, Echinoderms and Mollusks) and how their body size, extinction rates, speciation rates and diversification rates changed over time. We will learn how to use R, a statistical programming language, to help us analyze body size data and find trends.

#### In addition to this, we have weekly guest speaker events featuring grad students, post docs, and professors in the Earth Sciences department at Stanford. We will also go on three field trips this summer. The first will be at New Brighton Beach to study marine fossils and the geology of the area. The second will be a two-day camping trip at Pinnacles NAtional Park where we will learn about the formation of the park and view fossils of mollusks and crabs. The final trip is a research boat trip with the Marine Science Institute where we will learn about marine animals and scientific research on the ocean. 

#### I've documented all these trips in the form of blogs. They are viewable through the blogs folder in this repository.
